# VegaFEM-qmake
The Vega FEM Library uses makefiles as build system. Sadly, those are only intended to build release versions for Linux and Mac. Debug builds or builds for windows are not provided. This project aims to fix those issues.  

I do not intend to change Vega itself. 

All acknowledgements for the Library go to the original authors.
